# bilat

Bilat library is technical analyse library for my needs. I have tradebot which is need MACD calculations. I tried to use ta-lib, but it have too many dependencies and writen on C. This library will be only in python. I will start with MACD indicator and will add some new indicators by necessity. You are welcome to contribute.

Bilat is reversed ta-lib, which is little bit funny in russian
